`if (is_page('Form page')) {
    if (function_exists('CF7DatePicker'))
       add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', array('CF7DatePicker', 'plugin_enqueues'));
}`

or

`function cf7dp_enqueues() {
    if (is_page('Form page')) {
        if (function_exists('CF7DatePicker'))
            CF7DatePicker::plugin_enqueues();
    }
}
add_action('init', 'cf7dp_enqueues');`
