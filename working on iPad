hello,
I was using contact form 7 with out your additions plugin and have implemented jquery manualy.
I was working fine. However, as I am using a responsive theme as cms, on a ipad the form was not working properly.
It is requested to define the field as date, so HTML5  wise on an ipad, no keyboard is poping up.

I was happy to see, there is you plugin. But I have not found to fix this. 
As I do not know much about php I need some help on this.

Another point I was looking for, a range of e.g. month will open in defined field.

Any ideas ?

thanks
haiphin
